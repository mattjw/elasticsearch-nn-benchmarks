# Elasticsearch nearest neighbour vector scoring benchmarks

Performance evaluation of vector nearest neighbour solutions
in Elasticsearch. 

### Prerequisites

Docker resources: Ensure your Docker is configured with sufficient
resources for reliable performance results. For reference, our original
experiments were run with the following set up:
- Hardware: MacBook Pro, 15-inch, 2018; 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7; 6 cores;
  16 GB RAM.
- Docker: Docker for Mac 2.1.0.3; Docker Engine 19.03.2; 11 GiB memory,
  6 CPUs; 1 GiB swap. 

```bash
pipenv sync
pipenv run invoke prep
```

### Insertion performance

```bash
pipenv run -m BLABLA
```

# Query performance

```bash
pipenv run -m BLABLABLA
```
